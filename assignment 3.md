# Cleaning data

My datasets have potential to have a few issues. 
- Spelling: my data include a lot of text, so may be susceptible to spelling errors. This is something to remain cognizant of and check.
- Metrics: my data could include a number of different units, or ways of writing out units. Units associated with various gases can be typed in a few ways, which will something to look out for. Particularly if the data has been input straight from each country's NDC and not cleaned already.
- Inconsistent formatting: again, with a lot of text and various ways to write units, it will be important to keep an eye on formatting. If data has simply been copied in directly from the NDCs, formatting will differ country to country (I don't think this is the case, but it will be something to check)
- Large datasets: my data is vast - it includes a lot of factors from a lot of different countries. I will want to be careful when identifying what to focus on, and refining it down, that I don't miss anything important.
