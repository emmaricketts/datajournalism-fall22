## Data Reporting Critiques
### [Flush With Cash, Biden Eclipses Trump in War for the Airwaves, New York Times, 17 Oct 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html)

#### Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.

Five - I was easily able to understand the insight the reporter was trying to convey.

* What was it?

The reporter was demonstrating how Biden was outspending Trump, often by a lot, on TV ads. They also explained how both candidates were spending advertising money strategically in various states.

* Was it in the headline?

"Flush With Cash, Biden Eclipses Trump in War for the Airwaves". This headline concisely sums up the key point of the story - that Trump was far behind in TV ad spending at the time of writing.

* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent

This piece had numerous data visualisations, and I was able to understand them all. However, some were easier than others. They ranged from 3 - 5 on a 5-point scale.
The graphs showing *Weekly spending on TV ads in critical battlegrounds* were an example of an excellent visualation. They were easy to read at a glance, and shared information that complemented the story. The chart titled *Spending by media markets in each state*, on the other hand, was less effective. It was difficult to read and required some straining of the eyes to see which colour circle was on the outside for each point on the visual.

* Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?

Scrolling through the article demonstrated how the visuals complemented the story and became increasingly specific on the way through (i.e. from weekly spending on a national level to weekly spending in particular media markets.)

* Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?

I cannot, I found the way this story was laid out to be very effective.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate

I believe the data was accurate. This story was published in the New York Times, which is a trusted and reputable outlet. The sources are listed at the end of the article - Advertising Analytics; Harvard Dataverse (media market boundaries); The Cook Political Report (race ratings). Additionally, the story includes quotes from both the Trump and Biden campaigns, as well as experts. It appears to be thoroughly researched.

* List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.

I did not have reason to question the accuracy of any of the data.

* List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.

The reporter checked with a number of reputable sources and obtained comment from both campaigns. The research appears to be thorough and comprehensive. 

* Did they provide a source?

Yes, at the bottom of the article.

* Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

Yes, I was not left with any glaring questions.

#### Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

Yes, I rank it five. The story was informed and helpfully backed up with data visualisations in appropriate places. It includes sources and comments from both campaigns, adding to its trustworthiness.

* Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

The data visualisations were used relatively sparingly. There were not so many that the article provided an overload of information, but they appeared at times when it was useful to see the trends being described. I found they added to, rather than detracted from, the piece.

That said, the visualiations using circles were a little harder to understand. It required a closer look to understand the information being shared. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but may be skimmed over by the hurried reader.

#### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
*Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
For example, did it:*

|  Look like it all belonged together? | Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? | Make sense? | Type | Color | 
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ----- | 
| Yes, while a number of different charts were used, they all looked similar and flowed well. They used the same colours (aptly demonstrating both campaigns), fonts and sizing to ensure consistency. | The visualisations sat wider on the page than the text, instantly drawing the reader's eye to them. They included substantive captions, making the charts understandable to the reader before they read the text. This complemented the content well and provided context to the reader. | Yes, the visualisations clearly used red to signify the Trump campaign and blue for the Biden campaign. | Five. The way the data was arranged engaged the reader. The text, which was contained in a relatively narrow column, allows for quick reading down the page. It emulates a phone screen, which many are used to reading on. The visualisations sat a little wider than the text, which effectively drew attention to them and provided welcome breaks to the otherwise lengthy article. | Five. The colours used clearly signified the two different campaigns being discussed.


#### Creativity
1.  Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? Yes.
2.  How? The graphics added interest and visualisation to the story. They largely demonstrated data being described, but allowed the reader to see (and better understand) the difference in advertising spending. The use of maps in particular added context and relevance to the piece. As a reader, I was instantly drawn to each of the graphics and felt a better understanding of the numbers being shared with me.
3.  Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5: 5


## Story Pitch

Last week the SEC’s advisory panel on investor issues endorsed the agency’s plan to require companies to publicly report climate-related disclosures, including:
* material climate-related risks to the business;
* the governance of those risks;
* scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions;
* climate-related metrics; and
* information about climate-related targets and goals, if they exist.

Given recent increased pressure on banks and other financial insitutions to review their financed emissions and cut carbon across portfolios, I would like to look at the 15 largest banks in the U.S., and assess whether they already share climate-related matters with investors, or if they have plans to begin doing so. This will give an idea of those that are consciously considering the impact of climate change on their investors and are well-placed for the SEC's proposed new requirements.

For information, I would rely on the CDP (which gathers data on climate-related disclosures worldwide) and individual banks' annual reports and sustainability statements. For sources, I would try to reach out to sustainability spokespeople at each of the banks, and keep abreast of any new SEC announcements.
